4323,13-12-18,21:35:08,"Morag was born and educated in Edinburgh. After leaving school she graduated in Music Education at Lancaster University, then trained as an opera singer at the Royal Northern College of Music, where she was lucky enough to have singing lessons with Frederick Cox. More recently, as a mature student she completed an MA with distinction in Performance Health and Personal Development at London College of Music in 2011. She has a specific interest and continued academic study on Performance Psychology and the power of emotional expression in singing.

She has performed in a wide variety of opera, musicals, concerts and music theatre productions, including principal roles with Welsh National Opera (The Mother and Witch in <em>Hansel and Gretel</em>), Scottish Opera (Lucy in <em>Threepenny Opera</em>), The Royal National Theatre (Mrs Segstrom in <em>A Little Night Music</em>) and in the West End (Carlotta in <em>Phantom of the Opera</em>). She toured internationally with Opera Circus (The Good Wife in <em>Shameless an Immoral Tale</em>), presented on BBC Radio 3, released three solo CD‰Û_ÌãÌ_‰ö_ÌÔ‰ö_å´s and featured on RNT cast recording and other compilations. Morag presents her One Woman Shows worldwide and is currently a member of the opera improvisation group, <em>Impropera</em>, which has a residency at the London venue King‰Û_ÌãÌ_‰ö_ÌÔ‰ö_å´s Place.

Morag works as a vocal coach/consultant for emerging artists privately and has led performance workshops and master classes at The Guildhall School of Music and Drama, London College of Music, Ardingly International Music School, Guildford School of Acting, and The Cooper Hall Emerging Artists Workshop. Her teaching collaboration with Theresa Goble (<em>Vox Integra</em>) involves her in a range of vocal weekend workshops in London on a regular basis, with an emphasis on the integration of vocal skills with acting for singers. Her fun, playful, improvisational approach to this key element of vocal expression aims and has shown to tap creative potential, choice, individuality, and confidence in the performer. She strives to offer tools and ownership of a singer‰Û_ÌãÌ_‰ö_ÌÔ‰ö_å´s talent and ability, that liberates, and enables them to go out into the profession equipped to work freely and openly with directors and fellow performers, with a view to making them a welcome and employable company member. There is always a keen focus on ensemble quality and contact in her workshops, whilst at the same time providing opportunities for singers to take centre stage in the hope that they feel empowered as a soloist.

The nature of her workshops, as facilitation process work, and her breadth of professional performance experience, particularly in physical theatre and devising, has more recently and inevitably led Morag to directing.

Morag is Patron of Frome Festival, and as the founder and principal Trustee of The Cooper Hall Foundation charity (<a title=""Cooper Hall"" href=""http://www.cooperhall.org/"" target=""_blank"">www.cooperhall.org</a>), promotes music performances, education and the development of creative projects at Cooper Hall, a performance space, venue on the outskirts Frome, Somerset.

Her Cooper Hall Emerging Artists Workshop provides welcome and valuable opportunities for young professional singers to discover, learn about and experience the process of role development, rehearsal, working with an orchestra and performance. These productions create direct and meaningful links with the profession the young singers have chosen to pursue, in a nurturing as opposed to judgmental environment. Morag feels very strongly that this approach is key to assimilation of learning, and personal development.

In September (2015), Morag was delighted to have been invited to direct ‰Û_ÌãÌ_‰ö_ÌÔ‰ö_‰ä_Dido and Aeneas‰Û_ÌãÌ_‰ö_ÌÔ‰ö_å´ at London College of Music, where the process will be structured as a weekly session over the period of two academic terms, giving her a chance to explore further her ideas and principles of integration and process work for singers.

4347,13-12-18,21:39:47,"Stephen Cleobury has for over quarter of a century been associated with one of the world‰Û_ÌãÌ_‰ö_ÌÔ‰ö_å´s most famous choirs, that of King‰Û_ÌãÌ_‰ö_ÌÔ‰ö_å´s College, Cambridge. His work at King‰Û_ÌãÌ_‰ö_ÌÔ‰ö_å´s has brought him into fruitful relationships with many leading orchestras and soloists, among them the Academy of Ancient Music and the Philharmonia. He complements and refreshes his work in Cambridge through the many other musical activities in which he engages.

At King‰Û_ÌãÌ_‰ö_ÌÔ‰ö_å´s, he has sought to maintain and enhance the reputation of the world-famous Choir, considerably broadening the daily service repertoire, commissioning new music from leading composers, principally for A Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols, and developing its activities in broadcasting, recording and touring. He has conceived and introduced the highly successful annual festival, Easter at King‰Û_ÌãÌ_‰ö_ÌÔ‰ö_å´s, from which the BBC regularly broadcasts, and, in its wake, a series of high-profile performances throughout the year, Concerts at King‰Û_ÌãÌ_‰ö_ÌÔ‰ö_å´s. One of the most exciting innovations in this context was the first ever live simultaneous transmission of a concert (Handel Messiah) direct to cinemas across Europe and North America.

Between 1995 and 2007 he was Chief Conductor of the BBC Singers and since then has been Conductor Laureate. During his time with the Singers, he was much praised for creating an integrated choral sound from this group of first-class singers, all of whom are professional soloists in their own right. With the Singers he relished the opportunity to showcase challenging contemporary music and gave a number of important premieres, including Giles Swayne Havoc, Ed Cowie Gaia, and Francis Grier Passion, all these with the distinguished ensemble, Endymion. His many recordings with the BBC Singers include albums of Tippett, Richard Strauss and Bach.

From 1983 to 2009 he was Conductor of the Cambridge University Musical Society, one of the UK‰Û_ÌãÌ_‰ö_ÌÔ‰ö_å´s oldest music societies, a role in which he has not only conducted many orchestral works, but most of the major works for chorus and orchestra. Highlights have included Mahler Symphony No. 8 in the Royal Albert Hall and Britten War Requiem in Coventry Cathedral on the 50th anniversary of its bombing. His recordings with CUMS include Verdi Quattro Pezzi Sacri and Goehr The Death of Moses.
