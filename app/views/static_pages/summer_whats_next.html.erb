	<h3>For Solo singers</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Make sure you have sent us your song choices. It is advisable to come prepared to AIMS, ideally knowing your pieces from memory. It is not obligathory, but we find that students get so much more from the sessions when they are not 'note-bashing'.</li>
		<li>After the auditions, we will contact you if you have been successful, and inform you what is required.</li>
		<li>If you have been given a role to memorise, you <b>must</b> come <b>knowing your role off-copy</b> please. Scenes will not be performed unless every singer does this. If you arrived unprepared, you will be letting your fellow singers down.</li>
	</ul>
</section>

<section>
	<h3>For Choral singers</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Organise getting your music (either <a href='#buy_music'>buying yourself</a>, or you can order hire copies from the AIMS office, which can be collected at the sttart of the course).</li>
	</ul>
</section>

<section>
	<h3>For Crossover singers</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Your timetable will be prepared for you - this may involve further discussion with the AIMS Office, but anything is possible (in theory!).</li>
	</ul>
</section>

<section>
	<h3>For Piano Accompanists</h3>
